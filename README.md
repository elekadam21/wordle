# Wordle

This project was a recreation of the famous Wordle game, made in Vue.js using Vite.
The project was made on a company git account, but the original git history is accessible in this repository as an image.

Wordle is a web-based word game where players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position.
